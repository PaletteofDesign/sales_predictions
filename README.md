# Sales Predictions
The sales predictions project included using python to build a predictive model for outlet sales. During the process, the data was cleaned, organized, and analyzed to ensure proper performance of the analytical process. Below you can find several charts to help visualize the outcome of the different steps. 

The different models reviewed within the evaluation include linear regression, simple decision tree, bagged tree, and random forest. Out out of the 4 models the best performing was random forest. The random forest model demonstrated a better balance between variance and bias. The model was the strangest in prediction of future sales. The R2 score for both training and testing was 60%. The RMSE training score was 1081 and for testing was 1050. 60% of the variability of the model is explained by the the inputs provided to the model. 


The outcome of the project provided insight into potential ways to help improve outlet sales. Some of the results are less viable in terms of location and outlet size. The recommendation derived by the project was to increase sales performance through the type of items in demand and the MRP of the items sold. For example, seafood , having a higher coefficient, has a larger influence on outlet sales per unit sold over other items. By focusing more attention on said items can improve future sales results. The R2 score for both training and testing was 60%.
